BAR GRAPHS:
We might want to look at similar graphs that show:
20+ counties with the highest population over 60 years old
20+ counties with the highest population under 18 years old
20+ counties with the highest/lowest number of hospitals
20+ counties with the highest/lowest number of hospital beds
20+ counties with the highest percent of the population over 60 years old
20+ counties with the highest percent of the population under 18 years old
What might these graphs help us interpret? Which ones of these visualizations (or which other visualizations that aren't listed) can help us better understand which counties might be at risk for an increased number of COVID-19 cases or deaths? 

BUBBLE GRAPH EXAMPLE:
Are there US counties that have high populations of people over 60 and under 18 years old and that have low numbers of hospital beds per 1000 people? How have we seen these counties respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, and what might they be able to learn from this data to prepare for future crises?

CORRELATION HEATMAP:
What other correlations are important to note? What other data sets might we want to use and merge with the COVID-19 data to see what type of policies, partnerships, or support different counties might need to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus?
